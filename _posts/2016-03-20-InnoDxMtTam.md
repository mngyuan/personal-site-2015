One of the best things about InnoD is that sometimes, for no good reason, we go and take photos of beautiful people in beautiful places. About a month ago, we did just that and ventured to Mt. Tamalpais, a collection of hills hugging the coast just north of San Francisco.

But first, what trip would be complete without an aesthetic coffeeshop stop?

We hit the top of Mt. Tam around 4pm, our four cars or so, and went straight to work taking photo after photo.

Maybe it was just because it was the start of the semester, or that I hadn't seen everyone out and about for a while, but, I got a _little_ bit too excited this particular afternoon...

<div class='img fullbleed push'><img src="/i/blog/mttam/IMG_4215.jpg"/></div>

and took just under 700 photos.

So here's 20 or so of them.

As the sun started to set we chased its light from hill to hill, and I started to get a lotta my favorite type of photos: subject centered, aperture wide open, harsh light in the back.

Canon, Nikon, DSLR, mirrorless, film, iPhone - we didn't discriminate. In true InnoD fashion we came out in full force. @sphamphoto even stepped it up a notch and brought out the lightboxes ðŸ˜‚.

And on the other side of the hill, turned away from the golden wash of the setting sun, I found the master @bchauful at work

Thank god I turned around and took a second to appreciate this texture...

because just a few minutes later the moon started to rise, a gorgeous speck of white in the backdrop.

      <div class='img-caption'>Hey there, moon (just above Christine's head).</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

which led me to get probably one of my favorite photos I've taken, ever.

      <div class='img-caption'>I like this one so much I hardly want to share it - because it speaks to<br/>
      me for some reason, and I'm not sure everyone else will see it in the same way.</div>

There's the good photos, the ones I find later, coaxing them out while editing. Most of these fall into that category. Then there's the great photos, which I like enough to post to my Instagram immediately.

And then there's the photos that I really, really like, and for some reason, I'm not in a rush to share them. I mark them quietly and let them sit, and in return they make me think and they make me feel and they make me wanna say dumb, cheesy things, like all good things do.

Shoutout to everyone who was part of this - let's keep shootin.

Onto the next one,

&mdash; Kevin
