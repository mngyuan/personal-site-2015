It's hard, or, it's impossible to capture in a few words and sentences the emotion of a place. It's not as if faraway places vibrate with an entirely different energy - standing on a street corner, fumbling through your pocket for cash for the train is roughly the same in Seoul as it is in San Francisco.

It's more vague, like something fleeting that, when you look back for it, disappears though you swear it was there.

It's something in the way people walk, in the way their hands guide their words out their mouths, in the way their fingers fold over or into each other. How they look or don't look at each other in crowds.

I found, while traveling and while pouring over my mountains of unedited photos, that what I like to take photos of and what I like to talk about are entirely different.

In Seoul I rented a road bike for $5/hour

It was from a middle aged woman working the bike stand underneath the Ttukseom Resort subway station, the one with the weird bulbous looking building right on the water. She didn't speak English, and I didn't speak Korean, so we both pointed at things and at money and smiled as a nonverbal affirmation of "man, this is awkward".
