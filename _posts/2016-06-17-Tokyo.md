Going to Tokyo was my first glimpse of Japan, and of the places I visited I probably had the most expectations for Tokyo from hearing stories and seeing beautiful photos from friends. Strikingly clean and well organized, hyper modern and supremely compact, Japan lived up to the hype. A few things really stood out to me -

First, how damned clean it was.

I'd been to China many times, so the density of Asia wasn't too foreign to me. But until now my visits had taught me that with vast populations came certain compromises - pollution, dirty streets, and a loss of personal space and comfort. Japan flipped this notion on its head. I'd never seen a cleaner subway station or back alley than I'd see in Tokyo, and the general polish of the buildings and their lack of smears and any sign of urban erosion was unreal. Did people even live in these?
